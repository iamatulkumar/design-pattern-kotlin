/**
 * Without volatile modifier, itâ€™s possible for another thread in Java to see half initialized state of 
 * singleton object variable, but with volatile variable guaranteeing happens-before relationship,
 * all the write will happen on volatile sSoleInstance before any read of sSoleInstance variable.
 *
 * The volatile modifier is used to let the JVM know that a thread accessing the variable must always
 * merge its own private copy of the variable with the master copy in the memory.
 *
 * Accessing a volatile variable synchronizes all the cached copied of the variables in the main memory.
 *
 * The volatile keyword does not cache the value of the variable and always read the variable from the main memory
 *
 * Volatile can only be applied to instance variables,
 * which are of type object or private. A volatile object reference can be null.
